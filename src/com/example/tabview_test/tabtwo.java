The symbol version determines the data capacity. The area of a Version 1 QR Code is made up of 21 modules per side. Each higher version number is made up of 4 additional modules. The highest version number is Version 40. For example, a Version 2 QR Code would be composed of a 25 by 25 module matrix. If the module size is 0.5 mm (19.7 mils) square, the size of QR Code will be 12.5 mm (0.5\") square. (QR Code requires a four module wide quiet zone around the symbol.)";
